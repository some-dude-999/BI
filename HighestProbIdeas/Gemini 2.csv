business idea,success score,explanation
"Window/Gutter Cleaning & Pressure Washing",9,"Widely cited on r/sweatystartup as the highest probability success for beginners. Low barrier to entry (<$1k), high margins, and instant cash flow. Reddit consensus highlights that showing up on time and answering the phone puts you ahead of 90% of the competition."
"Event/Party Rental",8.5,"Favored over heavy equipment rental due to lower maintenance and liability. Redditors note it is scalable: start with basic folding tables/chairs (high utilization) and expand to tents. Less technical skill required than construction equipment."
"Bookkeeping/Accounting Services",8.5,"Consistently rated as 'boring but extremely stable.' High stickiness because businesses rarely switch accountants. Low overhead (laptop + software) and recession-proof demand. Reddit users warn it requires actual skill/certifications unlike manual labor services."
"Vertical B2B SaaS",8,"Generic SaaS is considered saturated/high-failure. Success is found in 'boring' verticals (e.g., software specifically for pet groomers, septic tank services, or legal workflows). Redditors advise building for industries still using spreadsheets, avoiding 'cool' tech trends."
"Commercial Cleaning Services",7.5,"High demand but noted for high churn and staffing headaches. Reddit consensus: 'Easy to start, hard to scale.' Success rate is high if the owner does the cleaning initially to ensure quality; 'passive' ownership from day one often leads to failure."
"Laundromat",7.5,"Starting from scratch is deemed high-risk due to zoning/utility costs. Buying an existing one is rated highly for stability ('recession resistant'), but Reddit users debunk the 'passive income' myth—machines require constant maintenance and coin collection."
"Pool Cleaning & Maintenance",7.5,"Praised for the recurring revenue model (subscription-based). Redditors note a 'sticky' customer base since homeowners dislike handling chemicals. Main failure point is underpricing; successful owners focus on repairs/equipment sales for higher margins."
"Junk Removal",7,"High demand ('trash never stops'), but capital intensive for trucks/bins. Success depends on marketing and logistics. Redditors suggest starting with junk removal (labor only) before investing in dumpsters to lower initial risk."
"Senior Home Safety Retrofitting",7,"Niche service (installing grab bars, ramps, smart monitoring) catering to the aging population. High willingness to pay for safety/reliability. Reddit users note less competition than general handy-work but requires building trust with families."
"Franchise (Service-Based)",6.5,"Better success rate than food franchises (which are often 'buying a low-paying job'). Service franchises offer a playbook for operations/marketing, but Redditors warn that royalty fees can eat margins that would otherwise be profit in an independent startup."
"Vending Machine Business",6,"Often hyped on social media but reality-checked on Reddit. Success is 100% location-dependent. High failure rate for beginners who buy machines before securing locations. Considered 'low risk' only because machines can be resold if the business fails."
