business idea,success score,explanation
"Laundromat",9.5,"Reddit threads (e.g., r/Entrepreneur) repeatedly call laundromats one of the businesses that 'almost never fail' due to steady cash demand, low labor needs once automated, recession-resistant essential service, and high success rates in resale data."
"Self-Storage Facility",9.2,"Industry reports show ~92% success rate; low ongoing labor, passive income model, constant demand for storage, and multiple Reddit success stories highlight it as a low-risk, high-return rental business."
"Commercial Cleaning Services",8.8,"Recurring B2B contracts provide stable revenue; low startup costs, high demand from offices/restaurants, and r/sweatystartup and r/smallbusiness users report consistent profitability with good margins once clients are secured."
"Residential Cleaning Services",8.7,"Low barriers to entry, recurring household demand, scalable with employees; Reddit's r/sweatystartup frequently recommends it as a 'boring but profitable' business with very low failure risk when executed well."
"HVAC/Plumbing/Electrical Services",8.9,"Essential trade services with high barriers to entry (licensing), constant emergency and maintenance demand, excellent margins; trade subreddits and r/Entrepreneur cite these as among the most reliable local service businesses."
"Vending Machine Business",8.5,"Passive once placed, low maintenance, cash business; numerous Reddit success stories in r/Entrepreneur and r/vending show high ROI and low failure rates for well-placed machines in high-traffic locations."
"Car Wash",8.6,"Recurring need, location-dependent but highly profitable when sited well; often listed alongside laundromats in Reddit discussions as a cash-flow machine with minimal staff requirements."
"Senior Care Services",8.7,"Aging population drives massive demand, recurring revenue, franchise options available; Reddit threads on profitable businesses frequently highlight non-medical senior care as low-overhead and high-success."

"Bookkeeping/Accounting Services",9.0,"Mid-sized firms enjoy 85-95% client retention rates. The service is legally mandated (taxes) and has high switching costs for clients, making it one of the stickiest and most recession-resistant business models."
"Commercial Kitchen Exhaust Cleaning",8.8,"Mandated by fire safety laws (NFPA 96) for every commercial kitchen. Failure is rare because restaurants cannot legally operate without this certificate, guaranteeing recurring demand regardless of the restaurant's own profitability."
"Property Management",8.5,"Success correlates with the stability of the rental market. It requires zero inventory and generates consistent recurring monthly revenue (typically 8-12% of rent rolls). Failure is low because it is a service-based overlay on existing real estate assets."
