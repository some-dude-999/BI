"Laundromat",9,"Reddit threads in r/Laundromats and r/smallbusiness describe laundromats as consistently profitable with steady cash flow in good locations; many owners report reliable income, semi-passive operation once established, and long-term stability as people always need clean clothes; failures usually tied to poor location or neglected maintenance rather than lack of demand."
"Self-Storage Facility",9,"Multiple Reddit discussions highlight self-storage as highly profitable with high occupancy rates, low operating costs, and recession-resistant demand; location-critical but once filled, very passive and scalable; often called one of the best real estate-based businesses."
"Car Wash",8,"Reddit users in r/sweatystartup and r/Entrepreneur frequently cite car washes as cash cows especially with subscription models; high margins, recurring revenue, and strong profits in busy areas; competition rising but proven model with many success stories."
"Franchise (Established Brand)",8,"Franchises have significantly higher survival rates than independent startups per multiple sources referenced on Reddit; proven systems, brand recognition, and corporate support reduce risk dramatically compared to starting from scratch."
"HVAC/Plumbing/Electrical Services",9,"Trades like plumbing and HVAC are repeatedly called 'recession-proof' on Reddit (r/sweatystartup, r/Entrepreneur); constant demand, high margins when owner-operated or scaled, licensed trades create barriers to entry; many owners report 7-figure revenues and strong profitability."
"Commercial Cleaning Services",8,"Low startup cost, recurring contracts, scalable with employees; Reddit success stories show quick profitability and ability to reach high revenue with B2B clients; demand from offices, schools, medical facilities rarely disappears."
"Residential Cleaning Services",7,"Very low barrier to entry, recurring clients, high demand; many Reddit posters started with almost no money and built profitable businesses; competition high but good reviews and reliability lead to steady growth."
"Lawn Care/Landscaping",8,"Seasonal in some areas but recurring seasonal revenue, low overhead if owner-operated; r/sweatystartup full of stories of companies scaling to millions with crews; essential service homeowners/businesses pay for consistently."
"Pest Control Services",8,"High margins, recurring service contracts, strong barriers (licensing); Reddit users note it's one of the most profitable home services with customers locked in annually."
"Vending Machine Business",7,"Low ongoing effort once locations secured, decent passive income; Reddit experiences vary but established routes often profitable; failure usually from poor location placement rather than the model itself."
