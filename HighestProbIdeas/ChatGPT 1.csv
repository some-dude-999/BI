"Commercial cleaning company (offices, schools, STRs)",10,"Commercial cleaning has predictable recurring contracts, low startup cost, and boring but essential work; multiple Reddit operators report stable six-figure revenue with 15–30% margins after a few years, indicating strong odds of durability when run well. (Reddit)"
"HVAC / plumbing / electrical contractor business",10,"These trades solve urgent, must-have problems where customers rarely shop only on price; boring-business threads repeatedly cite HVAC, plumbing, and electrical as quietly very profitable, and construction-related trades show mid-to-high survival when competently managed. (Reddit)"
"IT managed service provider (MSP) for small businesses",9,"MSPs sell recurring B2B contracts for critical IT uptime, creating sticky revenue; Reddit MSP owners report stable six-figure+ income and strong acquisition multiples, and the broader professional/technical services bucket has relatively high survival rates.

"Laundromat (buying an existing profitable store)",8,"Laundromats provide a basic necessity with steady usage and can be semi-absentee, and are frequently cited as low-risk cash-flow businesses, but they're capital-intensive and location/lease sensitive so the failure risk isn't trivial. (Reddit)"
