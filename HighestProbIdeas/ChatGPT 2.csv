business idea,success score,explanation
"Laundromat",10,"Coin laundries have some of the highest reported survival rates (often cited above 90% over 5 years) and are classic 'boring businesses': essential recurring demand, simple operations, self-service model, and low labor needs compared with revenue. (EBIT)"
"Self-storage facility",9,"Self-storage shows long tenant retention, recession resistance, and decades of steady growth; owners report high occupancy and only a few hours a week of work once systems are in place, giving both high stability and good margins. (EBIT)"
"Mobile home park ownership",9,"Mobile home parks combine very long tenant tenure, strong demand for affordable housing, and relatively low ongoing workload; industry reports show 10–20% returns and tenants who stay 10–15+ years, which makes revenue highly predictable once a park is stabilized. (EBIT)"
"RV and boat storage lot",8,"Outdoor storage for RVs and boats is essentially a specialized parking business with low operating costs, multi-year customer retention, and high occupancy; reports note operating expenses around 25–30% of revenue and frequent waitlists in good locations. (EBIT)"
"Automated or express car wash",8,"Reddit and industry writeups repeatedly list car washes as easy-to-run, low-employee, high-ROI businesses with subscription memberships that smooth revenue; capital costs are real, but once built, they can be mostly self-serve with relatively few failure stories compared with restaurants. (Reddit)"
"Vending machine route business",8,"Vending machines appear in many 'boring business' and 'low-maintenance' lists; once locations are secured, they generate recurring small transactions with minimal labor and can be scaled route by route, so operators on Reddit and blogs describe steady cash flow and low closure rates. (Reddit)"
"Parking lots and small parking garages",8,"Owning or leasing land and monetizing it as paid parking is another commonly cited low-employee, low-complexity model; demand in dense areas is durable, equipment is simple, and Reddit operators highlight that most failures are due to overpaying for land rather than the business model itself. (Reddit)"
"HVAC services company",8,"Heating and cooling are non-discretionary: equipment breaks and must be fixed; Reddit threads are full of examples of small HVAC shops doing seven figures in revenue, and industry roundups put HVAC among the most profitable 'boring' service trades with recurring maintenance contracts. (Reddit)"
"Plumbing services business",8,"Plumbing is an essential, often emergency service with chronic labor shortages; boring-business lists highlight strong margins and constant demand, and Redditors point out that competent plumbers in many markets are booked out weeks, which reduces competitive pressure and keeps failure rates relatively low. (Passionate Agency)"
"Electrical or general home-repair contractor",8,"Home repair trades (electricians, handymen, small contractors) are regularly cited as 'main street' businesses that never seem to disappear; demand is steady, skill barriers are meaningful, and commenters note good job security and plenty of work as younger generations outsource basic repair tasks. (Reddit)"
"Pest control services",8,"Pest control has predictable recurring demand (quarterly or monthly visits), low equipment costs, and high customer stickiness once a route is built; it appears frequently in profitable boring-business lists with strong margins and relatively fast paths to profitability. (Passionate Agency)"
"Commercial cleaning and janitorial services",8,"Office and commercial cleaning is unglamorous but highly recurring and contract-based; blogs and Reddit stories stress that once you land a few reliable contracts, churn is low and cash flow is stable, which tends to make closures less common than in trend-driven retail. (Passionate Agency)"
"Landscaping and lawn care",7,"Simple, repeatable outdoor services (mowing, blowing, basic clean-ups) are held up on Reddit as classic low-risk, low-startup-cost businesses; they benefit from recurring seasonal work but face weather swings and heavy competition, so success is common but not as automatic as more capital-moat models like storage. (Reddit)"
"Property management company",7,"Managing rentals for landlords creates recurring fee income tied to long-term leases; boring-business guides note solid profitability and resilience in real estate-related services, though the business can be operationally messy (tenant issues, owner expectations), which introduces execution risk. (Passionate Agency)"
"Funeral home or cremation services",9,"Death-care businesses are about as non-cyclical as it gets; they appear in high-survival, high-margin industry lists and boring-business roundups because demand is stable regardless of the economy, and established providers tend to face limited local competition and very long operating lives. (Passionate Agency)"
"Bookkeeping and tax-preparation practice",8,"Tax, bookkeeping, and small-business accounting are mentioned as steady 'always needed' services; professional-services sectors like this generally show above-average survival rates, driven by recurring annual work and high switching costs once clients trust you. (Reddit)"
"Independent insurance agency",8,"Insurance agencies sell products with built-in recurring premiums and renewal commissions; Reddit 'main street' discussions point out that local insurance, escrow, and related financial services have quietly persisted for decades in many towns, reflecting durable demand and relatively high survival. (Reddit)"
"Dog daycare, boarding, and grooming",7,"Service-industry Reddit threads highlight pet services—dog walkers, daycares, and groomers—as fast-growing, especially in high cost-of-living areas where busy owners outsource pet care; demand is strong but operations are labor-intensive and location-sensitive, so execution matters. (Reddit)"
"Indoor kids play gym and birthday-party center",7,"Operators in 'main street' discussions describe children's indoor playgrounds and party venues as steady earners: parents pay for safe, climate-controlled spaces and expensive birthdays, giving strong weekend and membership revenue, but leases and insurance costs mean poor management can still sink them. (Reddit)"
"Niche B2B SaaS for a boring industry",6,"Most tech startups fail, but small, vertical SaaS tools that automate unsexy workflows (field service scheduling, compliance tracking, niche ERPs) can achieve very sticky recurring revenue once product–market fit is found; still, software has higher early failure rates than the boring local services above, so the risk is meaningfully higher. (Medium)"
