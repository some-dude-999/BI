PROJECT: BI - Business Idea Analysis System
COMPONENT: AGI Command Panel - Multi-LLM Query Launcher
CREATED: 2025-11-19
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-19 - Initial documentation created

DATA SOURCES:
- User Input: Prompt text areas - queries to send to multiple AI models
- LocalStorage: agiPrompts - saved prompt templates stored in browser
- Static Data: AI_URLS object - URLs for Claude, Kimi, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Streamline the process of querying multiple AI language models simultaneously with the same prompt
- Key Functions:
  * openAGIPanel() - Opens multiple browser tabs based on selected LLM quantities (with 500ms delays between tabs)
  * setAllLLMs(value) - Master control to set all LLM selectors to the same value (0-10)
  * copyPromptToClipboard(textareaId) - Copies prompt text to clipboard using Navigator API
  * savePrompt() - Saves current prompt to localStorage with auto-generated name ("Prompt 1", "Prompt 2", etc.)
  * createPromptBox(name, text) - Dynamically creates colored prompt containers with copy/save functionality
  * removePromptBox(name, promptId) - Removes prompt from DOM and localStorage
  * saveCopyOfPrompt(promptId, originalName) - Creates a duplicate of existing prompt with incremented name
  * loadSavedPrompts() - Loads all saved prompts from localStorage on page load
  * showNotification(message) - Displays temporary success/error notifications (3-second duration)

- Event Handlers:
  * Master Control dropdown - Sets all LLM selectors to same value
  * Individual LLM selectors - Choose 0-10 tabs to open per model
  * "OPEN AGI PANEL" button - Triggers multi-tab opening sequence
  * Copy Prompt buttons - Copy text to clipboard
  * Save Prompt buttons - Store prompts in localStorage
  * Remove prompt (X) buttons - Delete saved prompts

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries: None (vanilla JavaScript)
- Browser APIs:
  * localStorage - For persistent prompt storage
  * Navigator Clipboard API - For copy-to-clipboard functionality
  * window.open() - For opening multiple browser tabs
- Project Files:
  * Standalone HTML file (no dependencies on other project files)
  * Works with AGI IDEA GEN.html in workflow (but not programmatically connected)

INTEGRATION:
- Receives data from: User manual input (prompts, LLM selection)
- Sends data to: Opens external URLs (claude.ai, chatgpt.com, etc.) in new tabs
- Triggers: User clicks "OPEN AGI PANEL" button
- Workflow Integration:
  1. User crafts prompt in AGI Panel
  2. Opens multiple AI model tabs simultaneously
  3. User manually pastes prompt into each tab
  4. User manually exports responses to CSV files
  5. CSV files loaded into AGI IDEA GEN.html for analysis

STYLING & UI:
- Theme: Cyberpunk/terminal aesthetic with neon green (#00ff88) primary color
- Animations: Scanning lines, pulsing glow effects, gradient borders
- Color Coding: 8 different colors for saved prompts (rotating color assignment)
- Responsive: Grid layout for LLM checkboxes, flexible button groups

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- AI Model URLs:
  * Claude: https://claude.ai/
  * Kimi: https://www.kimi.com/
  * ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/
  * Grok: https://grok.com/
  * Gemini: https://gemini.google.com/
- Tab Opening Sequence: Claude → Kimi → ChatGPT → Grok → Gemini (500ms delays)
- LocalStorage Key: "agiPrompts" (JSON object with prompt names as keys)
- Prompt Box Color Classes: color-1 through color-8 (rotating)
- Default Master Control Value: 2 tabs per LLM

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
[None yet - initial documentation]

NOTES:
- Browser pop-up blocker must be disabled for multi-tab opening to work
- Maximum 10 tabs per LLM (configurable via dropdown)
- Saved prompts persist across browser sessions (localStorage)
- Default prompt template suggests CSV output format for idea analysis
- Prompt counter increments globally (not reset on page reload)
- Color assignment cycles through 8 colors using modulo operation

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Could add direct CSV export functionality
- Could integrate API calls to AI models (if available)
- Could add prompt versioning/history
- Could add sharing functionality for prompt templates
