PROJECT: Business Intelligence / Idea Analysis System
COMPONENT: Centralized Idea Scores Viewer with Top Secret Theme
CREATED: 2025-11-21
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-21 - Critical bug fixes: CSV validation, contextual labeling, and proper data formatting

DATA SOURCES:
- Folder: AGI IDEA GEN/*.csv - AGI-focused business ideas with LLM evaluations (Scores: 0-10)
- Folder: FutureHighProbIdeas/*.csv - Future high-probability business ideas for AI age (Scores: 0-10)
- Folder: HighestProbIdeas/*.csv - Highest probability business ideas (Scores: 0-10)
- Folder: MarketTop2025/*.csv - Market top price predictions for 2025 (Values: Dollar amounts)
- Each folder contains 10 CSV files (ChatGPT 1, ChatGPT 2, Claude 1, Claude 2, Gemini 1, Gemini 2, Grok 1, Grok 2, Kimi 1, Kimi 2)
- CSV Format: "Name", Value, "Reasoning/Comment"
  * Score datasets: Value is 0-10 rating
  * Price datasets: Value is dollar amount

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Consolidated view for all idea score reports from different research runs
- Key Functions:
  * Dynamic dataset selector - dropdown to choose which research run to view
  * Tab-based navigation between different data sources (AGI IDEA GEN, FutureHighProbIdeas, etc.)
  * Combined view showing averaged scores across all LLMs
  * Individual LLM views for detailed analysis
  * Outlier removal toggle for more accurate averaging
  * Rocket emoji filter (🚀) to show only user-generated ideas
  * Sortable columns for score-based analysis
  * Modal popups for full comments and score calculation breakdowns
- Event Handlers:
  * Tab switching with ASMR paper sound effects
  * Expandable sections with paper rustling sounds
  * Score badge clicks to show calculation details
  * Comment button clicks to show full LLM reasoning
- Visual Theme:
  * Yellow legal pad aesthetic with horizontal lines
  * "Top Secret Report" header in red
  * Random report numbers for spy file folder feel
  * Old-fashioned, vintage document styling
  * Tab navigation styled like file folder tabs

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries: None (vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- Project Files: All CSV folders in /home/user/BI/
- APIs Required: None (client-side only, loads CSV files via fetch)
- Sound Files: ASMR paper sounds embedded as data URIs or external audio files

INTEGRATION:
- Receives data from: CSV files in AGI IDEA GEN/, FutureHighProbIdeas/, HighestProbIdeas/, MarketTop2025/
- Sends data to: None (read-only viewer)
- Triggers: User interactions (tab clicks, dropdown selection, button clicks)
- Similar Files: AGI IDEA GEN.html, FutureHighProbIdeas.html, HighestProbIdeas.html (single dataset viewers)

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
- Initially thought: Each HTML would only show one dataset
- Actually: ViewIdeaScores.html consolidates ALL datasets into one interface
- Why this matters: Reduces clutter as research operations scale, provides centralized reporting

BUG FIXES (2025-11-21):
1. **CSV Validation**: Added robust validation to filter out malformed data
   - Filters entries with CSS code (font-family, rgba, etc.)
   - Filters NaN and invalid score values
   - Validates score ranges (0-10 for ideas, positive for prices)
   - Prevents display of corrupted data in tables

2. **Contextual Column Labels**: Fixed generic "Threat Level" labels
   - Score datasets (AGI, Future, Highest): Now show "Score" and "Avg Score"
   - Price datasets (MarketTop2025): Now show "Price Target" and "Avg Price Target"
   - Item names adapt: "Idea Name" vs "Asset Name"

3. **Proper Data Formatting**:
   - Score datasets: Display as X.XX (e.g., "8.75")
   - Price datasets: Display as $XXX,XXX (e.g., "$160,000")
   - Calculation breakdowns show properly formatted values

4. **Data Integrity**: All calculations and displays now use validated, properly formatted data
   - No more NaN entries
   - No more CSS code appearing as data
   - Consistent formatting across all views

NOTES:
- This is a master viewer that prevents the need for 100+ separate HTML files
- Users can switch between different research runs using tabs
- All features from individual HTML files are preserved (outlier removal, sorting, filtering, popups)
- Yellow legal pad theme creates engaging, spy-themed user experience
- ASMR sounds enhance the tactile feel of browsing "secret files"
- Random report numbers add fun element to data review process
- Data accuracy prioritized over aesthetic theme (functionality > cuteness)
