COMPONENT: Market Top 2025 Price Prediction Analysis Dashboard
CREATED: 2025-11-19
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-19 - Initial creation

DATA SOURCES:
- CSV Files: MarketTop2025/*.csv (10 files total)
  * ChatGPT 1.csv - ChatGPT first prediction run
  * ChatGPT 2.csv - ChatGPT second prediction run
  * Claude 1.csv - Claude first prediction run
  * Claude 2.csv - Claude second prediction run
  * Gemini 1.csv - Gemini first prediction run
  * Gemini 2.csv - Gemini second prediction run
  * Grok 1.csv - Grok first prediction run
  * Grok 2.csv - Grok second prediction run
  * Kimi 1.csv - Kimi first prediction run
  * Kimi 2.csv - Kimi second prediction run

CSV STRUCTURE:
- Column 1: Asset Name (e.g., "Bitcoin", "S&P 500", "Gold")
- Column 2: Predicted Top Price (numeric value)
- Column 3: Predicted Date (date string)
- Column 4: Reasoning (text explanation for the prediction)

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Display and analyze market top price predictions from multiple LLMs for 2025
- Key Functions:
  * parseCSV() - Parses CSV files with asset predictions
  * formatPrice() - Formats prices with $ and commas (e.g., $185,000.00)
  * formatDate() - Formats dates nicely (e.g., "Jan 2026", "Apr 2026")
  * calculateAverage() - Calculates average price across LLMs with optional outlier removal
  * getCombinedData() - Combines all LLM predictions for each asset
  * createCombinedTable() - Creates combined view with average prices
  * createLLMTable() - Creates individual LLM prediction tables
  * showPriceCalculation() - Shows popup with price calculation breakdown
  * showIndividualPrediction() - Shows individual LLM prediction details
  * showReasoning() - Shows reasoning in modal popup

- Event Handlers:
  * LLM checkbox toggles - Filter which LLMs to include in analysis
  * "Remove Outliers" checkbox - Toggle outlier removal (removes highest and lowest when 3+ predictions)
  * Tab switching - Switch between Combined view and individual LLM views
  * Column sorting - Sort by predicted price (ascending/descending)
  * "Show Reasoning" buttons - Display reasoning popups
  * Price click in Combined view - Show calculation breakdown

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries: None (vanilla JavaScript)
- Project Files:
  * MarketTop2025/*.csv files (10 CSV files)
- APIs Required: None (all data from local CSV files)

INTEGRATION:
- Standalone dashboard
- Based on structure from "AGI IDEA GEN.html"
- Receives data from: CSV files in MarketTop2025/ folder
- Sends data to: None (display only)
- Triggers: Loads automatically on page load via loadAllCSVs()

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM AGI IDEA GEN.html:
1. Theme: Financial colors (green to red gradient) instead of purple
2. Removed: "🚀 Our Ideas Only" filter (not relevant for market data)
3. Data structure: asset name, price, date, reasoning (vs idea name, score, reasoning)
4. No color gradient on prices - displayed as regular formatted numbers
5. Price formatting: $ sign with commas (e.g., $185,000.00)
6. Date formatting: Human-readable format (e.g., "Jan 2026")
7. Column headers: "Asset Name", "Predicted Top Price", "Predicted Date", "Show Reasoning"
8. Button text: "Show Reasoning" instead of "Show Comment"
9. Calculation shows price averaging instead of score averaging

DESIGN CHOICES:
- Financial theme with green/red colors (bull/bear market colors)
- Prices displayed without color gradient for clarity and readability
- Outlier removal option maintained for better consensus analysis
- Interactive features: sortable columns, tabbed interface, modal popups
- Responsive design with hover effects and smooth animations

NOTES:
- Ensure all 10 CSV files exist in MarketTop2025/ folder before using
- CSV files must have correct format: name, price, date, reasoning
- Outlier removal only applies when 3+ LLMs have predictions for an asset
- Prices are sorted from highest to lowest by default
- All monetary values formatted with 2 decimal places
