idea name,1 to 10 score,a brief explainer of your reasoning
Custom automation & internal tools for companies 🚀,9.9,"B2B integration is the highest value. The AI-generated code is a commodity, but the human service of understanding a business's needs, integrating the code into legacy systems, and providing maintenance is a high-margin, sticky, and non-automatable service."
AI Integration & B2B Consulting,9.8,"A broader, higher-margin version of the top idea. This is a pure human service (strategy, workflow design, change management) that uses the superhuman AI as a tool. This leverages the AI's power for high-value B2B clients who pay for solutions, not content."
Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) Premium Services,9.0,"High-margin services like 'super-tutoring,' executive coaching, or therapy. The AI provides 99% of the 'superhuman' knowledge, but the human provides the 1% of accountability, empathy, and real-world application, which becomes the scarce, premium value."
Human-Made IP & Authenticity Verification,8.5,"This idea creates value from scarcity. In a world flooded with superhuman AI content, 'provably human-made' art, music, or writing becomes a premium luxury good. This business would be the 'authenticator' or 'appraiser' of human-origin goods."
Taste-Based Curation Brands,7.5,"In a world of infinite, perfect content, the new bottleneck is attention and discovery. The value is not in *creation* but in *curation*. This business would be a trusted brand (e.g., 'The A24 of AI Sci-Fi') that uses AI to generate a consistent, high-quality stream of content, monetizing the *brand* and *trust*, not the content itself."
STEM learning games 🚀,6.0,"This is a B2C content play, which is much harder than B2B. The game content itself is a commodity. The only path to profitability is building a massive brand and community (like Duolingo), which is extremely difficult and capital-intensive. It's a 'winner-take-all' market."
Math learning games 🚀,6.0,"This is a B2C content play, which is much harder than B2B. The game content itself is a commodity. The only path to profitability is building a massive brand and community (like Duolingo), which is extremely difficult and capital-intensive. It's a 'winner-take-all' market."
Language learning games 🚀,6.0,"This is a B2C content play, which is much harder than B2B. The game content itself is a commodity. The only path to profitability is building a massive brand and community (like Duolingo), which is extremely difficult and capital-intensive. It's a 'winner-take-all' market."
General learning games 🚀,6.0,"This is a B2C content play, which is much harder than B2B. The game content itself is a commodity. The only path to profitability is building a massive brand and community (like Duolingo), which is extremely difficult and capital-intensive. It's a 'winner-take-all' market."
"3D printing files across niches (e.g., 28mm biopunk) 🚀",4.0,"The digital STL files are worthless commodities in this world; anyone can generate 'tens of thousands' of them. The 1% commercial license is unenforceable. The only revenue comes from affiliate links to physical printers/resin, which is a low-margin, standard e-commerce referral business."
"Print-on-demand graphics (t-shirts, stickers, etc.) 🚀",3.0,"A total race to the bottom. If everyone can generate 'tens of thousands' of perfect t-shirt designs, the value of a design is zero. You are just a middleman in a physical goods business, competing with millions of others. Margins would be non-existent."
"Printable activities (coloring pages, mazes, sudoku) 🚀",2.0,"The 99% free/1% paid model is fundamentally broken here. A 'teacher's license' is worthless when that same teacher can use the cheap AI to generate their *own* perfect, custom printables for pennies. Ad revenue on a free coloring site would be negligible."
Ambient music for sleep & relaxation 🚀,1.5,"A 'commercial license' is a nonsensical product. Why would a YouTuber pay $10/month for your AI music when they can use the *same* superhuman AI to generate their *own* perfect, unique, commercially-free ambient music for their video? The product has no value."
Children's books for language learning 🚀,1.0,"This is the clearest example of a commodity. If the AI can *actually* generate a book 'on par with Harry Potter,' then it can generate *infinite* books on par with Harry Potter. The value of any single book (and its IP) falls to zero. There is no scarcity to monetize."
