SPY,780,Mar 2026,"Markets are in extreme fear (CNN F&G ~9-15) after a sharp Nov 2025 pullback from Oct highs (~687 SPY / ~6600 S&P). Yield curve normal but recession risks rising (20-40% prob for 2026 per JPM/Deloitte). Debt/GDP ~125-130%, sticky inflation, tariff shocks, and potential Fed pause create blow-off top in Q1 2026 before crash triggered by earnings misses and liquidity drain; mirrors late-cycle euphoria before 2000/2008. Bottom ~450 in late 2027."
QQQ,720,Mar 2026,"Tech-heavy Nasdaq down harder in Nov correction (QQQ ~596 from ~636 high). AI hype still strong but valuations extreme; same macro risks as SPY plus sector rotation away from mag7. Top tick in final mania phase Q1 2026 before AI capex slowdown and recession hits growth stocks. Bottom ~400 in late 2027."
BTC,185000,Apr 2026,"Cycle lengthening due to ETFs/institutions (Bitwise: 4-year cycle dead). Current ~91k in fear (Crypto F&G ~10-15), but halving dynamics + nation-state buying push one more leg up. Top later than classic Oct/Nov 2025 window; ~2x from here fits moderated returns. Bear market bottom ~70k late 2026."
ETH,8500,Apr 2026,"ETH lagging BTC (current ~3100) but upgrades (Fusaka) + ETF inflows support catch-up. Ratio to BTC improves in alt season during final bull leg. Top with BTC; bottom ~3000 late 2026."
BNB,1400,Apr 2026,"BNB resilient (current ~920) tied to Binance ecosystem. Benefits from broader crypto liquidity; top with market, bottom ~500 late 2026."
DOGE,0.65,Apr 2026,"Meme strength in euphoria phase; current ~0.16 in fear. Historical meme blow-offs huge in final leg; top splash before crash, bottom ~0.08 late 2026."
WLD,4.2,Apr 2026,"Worldcoin volatile/privacy concerns but AI/biometric narrative fits late-cycle hype. Current ~0.69; explosive upside in greed phase, bottom ~0.50 late 2026."
