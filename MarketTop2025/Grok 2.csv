SPY,720,2026-06,"Current ~600-620 range after recent pullback from highs near 635-637. Valuations extremely elevated (Shiller CAPE second-highest ever), AI bubble showing cracks, yield curve steepening post-longest inversion signals growth concerns delayed but incoming. Fear/Greed in extreme fear zone amid 2025-11 selloff. Recession risks rising (30-40% odds for 2026-27 per models/analysts) from debt, potential policy missteps, overextended tech. Top tick as final euphoric splash before 30-50% bear market/recession crash; many sources (Reddit, analysts) converge on 2026 as correction year."
QQQ,780,2026-05,"Current ~596-608 after peaking ~637 2025-10. Heaviest AI/tech exposure makes it most vulnerable to bubble burst. Same macro risks as SPY but amplified; historical parallels to dotcom suggest sharp reversal once earnings miss hype. Extreme fear in 2025-11 dip is contrarian buy signal short-term but cycle top likely Q2 2026 before major leg down."
CQQQ,58,2026-04,"Current low-40s amid China stimulus but still battered. Less correlated to US bubble but rides global risk-on. Potential final rally on easing US-China tensions/China recovery hopes, but capped by geopolitical risks and weaker fundamentals vs US tech. Top earlier than US indices as China leads risk-off in downturn."
BTC,185000,2025-11,"Current ~93-96k after correction from ~126k highs. Classic halving cycle (2024 halving) points to peak ~18 months post-halving (Oct-2025-11 common forecast). Diminishing returns vs prior cycles but institutional inflows/ETFs extend slightly. Extreme fear (index 10-15) in 2025-11 = capitulation low, final parabolic splash to top tick before 2026 bear (70-80% drawdown typical)."
ETH,6800,2025-12,"Current ~3000-3200. Follows BTC but with alt premium in blow-off top. L2/upgrades provide narrative fuel for final leg. Peaks slightly after BTC; ratio often expands late-cycle."
BNB,1200,2025-12,"Current ~880. Binance ecosystem strength + exchange token utility gives leverage to bull. Often outperforms in late mania phases."
WLD,14,2026-01,"Worldcoin (WLD) narrative-driven (AI/identity). High beta alt, extends longer in euphoria but volatile; splash top post-BTC peak."
DOGE,1.20,2026-01,"Meme king – purest greed play. Historically extends farthest in blow-off (2021 style). Social/media pumps create highest multiple splash before total collapse in bear."
