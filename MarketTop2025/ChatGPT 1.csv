SPY,550,Jun 2026,"Broad market maybe peaks around mid-2026 as liquidity still strong, valuations rich, yield cuts anticipated but maybe delayed. SPY current ~450ish (as of Nov 2025). A roughly +20% run to ~550 then rollover."
QQQ,400,Jun 2026,"Nasdaq/tech heavy; speculative froth high so likely similar timing as SPY but maybe sharper afterwards."
Bitcoin,250000,Apr 2026,"Bitcoin might benefit from final speculative blow-off; institutional flows, hype around halving cycle may push it to ~$250k."
Ethereum,15000,Apr 2026,"ETH perhaps hits ~$15k in same speculative mania period, led by DeFi/roll-ups hype."
BNB,1000,Apr 2026,"BNB (Binance ecosystem) maybe hits ~$1k in that cycle top."
Dogecoin,2.50,Apr 2026,"DOGE as meme-play could spike to ~$2.50 in speculative mania."
Worldcoin,50,Apr 2026,"Worldcoin (WLD) relatively new; if mania takes hold, maybe $50 peak (very speculative)."
