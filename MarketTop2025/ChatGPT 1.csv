SPY,780,2026-06,"Highly speculative scenario, not investment advice. Assumes one more AI-led melt-up once current extreme fear passes (CNN Fear & Greed Index ~12, i.e., extreme fear), aided by the Fed halting QT around 2025-12 and stabilizing liquidity. Valuations are already stretched with Shiller CAPE around 40, similar to late-1990s extremes. My base case: SPY grinds higher toward ~780 by mid-2026 as earnings remain decent and AI/capex narratives stay strong. Next major US recession likely begins around late 2026, driven by lagged impact of high real rates, high public and private debt service, and a rollover in AI/tech investment; several mainstream forecasts put recession odds around 40% by 2026. In that scenario, SPY could fall roughly 35–40% from this projected peak to a low near ~470 around 2028-03 before a new secular leg, with the crash phase concentrated between late 2026 and 2027."
QQQ,730,2026-06,"Also highly speculative. QQQ is more concentrated in mega-cap tech and AI beneficiaries; valuations and concentration risk are even more extreme than the broad S&P, and multiple observers describe conditions as bubbly, especially in AI/semis. With SPY already above 660 and QQQ near 600 today, a final risk-on leg driven by renewed rate-cut hopes and FOMO could plausibly push QQQ into the ~700–760 band; I pick ~730 in 2026-06 as a stylized top tick. Crash trigger is likely a combination of (a) earnings disappointment as AI capex proves lumpy rather than linear; (b) credit stress as funding costs stay high; and (c) valuation mean reversion once inflation proves sticky and the Fed cannot cut as quickly as markets hope. In that downturn, a ~45–50% drawdown from the peak (similar to prior tech busts) would put a QQQ low roughly in the ~370–400 area around mid-2028."
CQQQ,80,2026-04,"CQQQ (China tech) has already been through a brutal bear market linked to China's property bust, regulatory crackdown, and slower growth, so it is less obviously overvalued than US mega-cap tech. Current price around 52 reflects both structural headwinds and low sentiment. My base case is that a global risk-on window into 2026, coupled with marginal policy easing in China and some mean reversion in beaten-down tech, allows CQQQ to rally 40–60% from here, with a splashy top tick near 80 around 2026-04. The next global equity crash would likely hit CQQQ hard because it is high-beta to global growth and liquidity: in a US-led recession with weaker trade and risk aversion, capital could flow out of Chinese risk assets. In that scenario, CQQQ could revisit or slightly undercut prior cycle lows in the mid-30s around 2027–2028."
BTC,160000,2026-10,"Crypto projections are even more conjectural than equities. Bitcoin is around 90k after a sharp pullback from highs above 120k–125k earlier in 2025, and the crypto Fear & Greed Index is in extreme fear near 15—typical of mid-cycle shakeouts rather than euphoric final tops. Historically, BTC cycles have peaked 1–2 years post-halving; with the April 2024 halving, that points roughly to late 2025 through 2026. Analysts now debate whether this cycle will follow the old pattern or stretch longer given ETFs and institutional flows, with some mainstream research floats targets between 140k and 200k. My subjective most likely path: the current drawdown is a deep, sentiment-resetting correction; after macro and liquidity conditions stabilize, BTC makes one more leg higher into late 2026, reaching a blow-off top tick near 160k around 2026-10, coinciding with renewed retail FOMO and a second wave of ETF/institutional inflows."
ETH,8000,2026-10,"ETH currently trades just under 3k, still well below its prior-cycle peak near 4.8k, despite major upgrades (PoS, EIP-1559, scaling progress) and a growing L2/DeFi/NFT ecosystem. In prior cycles ETH has tended to outperform BTC late in the bull market as risk appetite rotates into smart-contract platforms. If BTC does push toward the 150k–170k zone in 2026, an ETH/BTC multiple somewhere in the 0.04–0.06 range during peak risk-on would be plausible based on history and current fundamentals, which would imply an ETH price cluster in the 6k–10k range. I pick a stylized top tick near 8,000 in 2026-10. The driver set: (a) a final wave of L2 and RWAs/DeFi narratives, (b) more spot or derivatives-based ETH products for institutions, and (c) a late-cycle chase into higher beta assets once BTC is too big to move."
BNB,1800,2026-11,"BNB is around 900 now after a huge cycle where Binance's ecosystem, BNB Chain, and continued burn mechanics have supported price despite regulatory overhangs. Historically BNB has shown late-cycle strength tied to exchange activity and speculation on new narratives/launches. Under a scenario where the broader crypto cycle extends into late 2026, and assuming Binance continues operating at scale with stable to growing volumes, a 2x from current levels into the late-cycle peak looks plausible. I therefore pick a speculative top tick near 1,800 around 2026-11. Given BNB's history of large drawdowns (60–80%) and its tight coupling to overall crypto liquidity and exchange trust, a subsequent bear phase overlapping a global risk-off could pull BNB back into the ~500–700 area sometime in 2028."
WLD,8,2026-03,"Worldcoin's WLD trades well under 1 today in many feeds after having previously spiked above 11 in 2024, and remains one of the most controversial tokens due to biometric data concerns and regulatory pushback. At the same time, it is deeply tied to AI and global ID narratives, which are front-and-center in this macro/tech cycle. If the broader AI + crypto narrative reignites in 2026, modest float plus speculative flows could reasonably push WLD back toward prior highs. I choose a speculative top tick of ~8 around 2026-03—below the old peak to reflect overhang from token unlocks, regulatory risk, and investor fatigue, but high enough to capture a renewed mania phase. Because small-cap/controversial tokens can experience 80–95% drawdowns, a post-peak bear-market low could easily be back under 1 (say 0.40–0.80) by 2027–2028 if adoption disappoints or regulators clamp down."
DOGE,0.60,2026-11,"DOGE sits around 0.15 now, far below its 2021 meme-mania high near 0.70, but still with a large, engaged retail base and periodic social-media-driven pumps. In late-cycle phases of prior crypto bulls, dog tokens and other memes have often dramatically outperformed fundamentals. Under a scenario where (a) BTC/ETH push to new highs in 2026, (b) retail enthusiasm returns, and (c) social-platform dynamics (including anything Elon-adjacent) reignite DOGE interest, a retest but not quite a clean break of the old high feels like a plausible most likely path. I therefore pick a top tick near 0.60 around 2026-11 as the point where liquidity is sloshing, memes are euphoric, and then the splash reverses abruptly."
