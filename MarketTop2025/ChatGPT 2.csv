SPY,800,2026-08,"Highly speculative scenario. US large-cap equities are at extreme valuations (Shiller CAPE around 40 and in roughly the 99th percentile of history), leaving the market vulnerable to any growth or earnings shock. After a last AI- and rate-cut-driven melt-up into mid-2026 as the Fed continues a cautious easing cycle, my base case is that SPY peaks near 800, then suffers roughly a 35–45 percent drawdown with a bottom in the 450–520 zone around 2027-10 as a mild-to-moderate US recession finally materializes with a lag from the 2022–24 tightening and the now-ended but record-long yield-curve inversion (NY Fed term-spread model currently shows about mid-20s percent 1-year recession odds). Liquidity shifts from Fed balance-sheet runoff and tighter credit conditions would be the main crash triggers; AI-heavy megacap concentration adds fragility."
QQQ,820,2026-08,"My base case is that Nasdaq-100 leadership persists into a late-cycle melt-up driven by AI and growth narratives, with QQQ overshooting to about 820 in the same general window as SPY (summer 2026) as rate cuts briefly re-ignite risk appetite. In this scenario, a subsequent 45–60 percent decline takes QQQ into the roughly 330–410 range by an 2027-10 bottom, coinciding with a profits recession and a US downturn that follows from past policy tightening and elevated corporate leverage. The most likely crash mechanism is an earnings disappointment in megacap AI names plus higher-for-longer real rates than equity bulls are assuming, forcing a repricing of long-duration tech cash flows."
CQQQ,70,2026-06,"China tech has been through a deep bear market already, but remains structurally constrained by geopolitics, regulation, and slower domestic growth. My best guess is that global risk-on and some policy support in China allow CQQQ to rally to around 70 by mid-2026 as investors chase under-owned laggards, but it likely tops earlier than US mega-cap tech because underlying macro and credit backdrops are weaker. From a 70 peak, a 40–50 percent drawdown to roughly 35–42 by late 2027 or early 2028 is plausible if a US-centred global slowdown and continued property-sector stress sap risk appetite for Chinese assets. Crash risk is more about global dollar liquidity tightening and renewed geopolitical shocks than local valuations, which are far less stretched than the US."
BTC,160000,2026-05,"Bitcoin is already near 90k with leverage and on-chain credit metrics making new highs, showing we are clearly in a late-cycle, high-greed phase. Reddit and broader sentiment are increasingly focused on timing the top of this cycle and debating whether the classic post-halving pattern will repeat, which is typical behaviour late in a bull run. My best-guess water-splash top tick is about 160k in 2026-05, coinciding with peak optimism about Fed cuts, AI-wealth spillover into crypto, and ETF-driven flows. A subsequent bear phase could plausibly take BTC down roughly 60–70 percent from that peak (to the 45k–65k region) into a mid-to-late-2027 bottom as US recession risk crystallizes, liquidity tightens at the margin, and leverage is forced to unwind."
ETH,10000,2026-05,"Ethereum has lagged BTC this cycle but remains a core liquidity and DeFi asset. With BTC at a hypothetical 160k peak, a BTC/ETH ratio in the 15–18 range would put ETH around 9k–11k; I anchor on 10k as a representative top tick in 2026-05 as L2 adoption, restaking narratives and a generalized alt season kick in, supported by easier Fed policy and residual risk-on sentiment. In the downside leg, a 70–80 percent drawdown from that peak (to roughly 2k–3k, overlapping today's price region) into a 2027 bottom is plausible given ETH's higher beta to liquidity, DeFi leverage, and regulatory uncertainty versus BTC."
BNB,1800,2026-05,"BNB trades as a mix of exchange equity-like claim, ecosystem gas token, and speculative high-beta asset. In a late-cycle crypto blow-off where BTC reaches around 160k, it is plausible that BNB overshoots to roughly 1800 in 2026-05 as volumes, perp trading and speculative activity spike. From there, a 70–80 percent decline into the 350–550 range by late 2027 is a reasonable base case as derivatives activity collapses, regulatory pressure on centralized exchanges continues, and overall crypto liquidity shrinks. Key risks to this view are extreme regulatory action (which could push the bottom much lower) or, conversely, more benign treatment that allows BNB to sustain a higher multiple for longer."
WLD,4,2026-04,"Worldcoin is a small, highly reflexive token tied to a controversial identity project and broader AI hype. In a strong late-cycle environment with AI narratives still hot and crypto lending at fresh highs, I could see a speculative spike to around 4 dollars in April 2026 as retail returns, major listings deepen liquidity, and a small-cap AI coin narrative emerges. Because fundamentals and regulatory outlook are very uncertain, a subsequent drawdown of 80–90 percent (to roughly 0.4–0.8) into a 2027 bottom is entirely plausible once liquidity retreats and attention rotates away. This asset is especially path-dependent and sensitive to regulatory action; the distribution of outcomes is extremely wide."
DOGE,0.60,2026-04,"Dogecoin tends to outperform in the frothiest phase of the cycle when retail enthusiasm and meme culture peak. With DOGE currently around 0.15 and no fundamental valuation anchor, a late-cycle spike to roughly 0.6 in April 2026 (roughly matching or modestly exceeding its prior cycle enthusiasm, but with less fresh retail stimulus than in 2021) is a reasonable top tick guess. From such a peak, a 75–90 percent drawdown into the 0.06–0.15 band by late 2027 is plausible as global liquidity tightens, US recession risk rises, and speculative memecoins fall out of favour. The main crash driver is simply the reversal of crowd psychology and leverage as broader risk assets roll over."
