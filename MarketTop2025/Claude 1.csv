SPY,780,Mar 2026,"Currently at 660. Shiller CAPE at 38 (2nd highest ever), Buffett Indicator at record 219%. Yield curve recently uninverted after 2+ year inversion - historically recession follows 6 months later. Fed cutting rates into strong economy could fuel final blow-off top. AI hype + tax cuts + liquidity injections could push one more 18% surge before reality hits. Crash likely Q2-Q3 2026 to 480-520 range (35% drawdown). Bottom around Oct 2026 at 450."
QQQ,750,Feb 2026,"Currently at 596. Tech heavily concentrated in AI megacaps (NVDA/MSFT/AAPL). Forward P/E at 35+ extreme levels. AI monetization bubble showing cracks per Sam Altman warnings. Final FOMO surge as retail chases performance into Q1 2026. Likely 25% run from here before 40-45% crash to 400-450 by Sept 2026. More volatile than SPY due to tech concentration."
CQQQ,85,Jan 2026,"Currently at 53. China tech follows global liquidity cycles but with higher beta. US-China tensions easing temporarily could spark 60% rally. Benefits from Fed easing + China stimulus combo. However extremely vulnerable to geopolitical shocks. Crash to 35-40 likely by mid-2026 as global recession fears mount and tensions re-escalate."
BTC,180000,Apr 2026,"Currently 92-100k. Halving was April 2024, historically peaks 12-18 months later. Extreme greed returning after recent fear. Institutional FOMO via ETFs + potential strategic reserves + Fed liquidity could drive parabolic move. Previous cycles: 2017 peak at 20x prior low, 2021 at 15x. Conservative 10x from 15k 2022 low = 150k, but final mania could push to 180k. Crash to 40-60k likely (-70% typical crypto winter)."
ETH,8500,Apr 2026,"Currently 3000-3600. Follows BTC with higher beta. Ethereum ETF flows + DeFi resurgence + staking yields attractive vs bonds. Layer 2 scaling finally working. At 0.05 BTC ratio could hit 9k if BTC reaches 180k. More utility than 2021 but still speculative premium. Crash to 1500-2000 likely (-75% historical drawdown)."
BNB,2200,Mar 2026,"Currently 900-1000. Binance ecosystem expanding, token burns deflationary. Benefits from altcoin mania phase. However regulatory risks remain high. Previous cycle peaked at 690, this time 3x higher with larger ecosystem. Crash to 400-500 likely as liquidity dries up and regulatory hammer falls."
WLD,12,Mar 2026,"Currently 0.65-0.80. Down 94% from 11.80 ATH. Sam Altman connection + AI narrative could drive massive retail FOMO. Low float/high FDV classic pump setup. Universal Basic Income narrative gains traction. But fundamentally questionable tokenomics. Wild speculation could drive 15-20x before crashing back to 1-2 (-85%)."
DOGE,0.85,Apr 2026,"Currently 0.16-0.18. Previous cycle peaked at 0.73. Meme coin mania returns in final crypto euphoria. Potential X payments integration + ETF speculation. Elon pump tweets inevitable. Benefits from retail accessibility and name recognition. But infinite supply + no utility = eventual return to 0.05-0.08 (-90% crash)."
