SPY,720,2025-11,"Current ~680-700 range after recent correction from highs; AI/tech euphoria still driving but valuations extreme (Shiller CAPE second-highest ever), yield curve re-inverted briefly earlier in 2025, rising unemployment risks, massive US debt servicing costs, and tariff-induced slowdown point to final melt-up in late 2025 before recession hits 2026; fear/greed in extreme fear now but greed returns briefly for blow-off top; bottom ~400-450 in late 2026/early 2027 on 40-45% bear market drawdown typical of recessions."
QQQ,750,2025-11,"Current ~596-620 after pullback from 637 high; tech/AI concentration extreme, similar to dotcom peak; same macro risks as SPY but amplified in growth stocks; final parabolic leg on liquidity before crash; bottom ~400 in 2026-2027."
CQQQ,65,2025-12,"Current suppressed by US-China tensions/tariffs; brief stimulus-driven rally possible but capped by ongoing trade war escalation; less upside than US indices, tops later/lower; bottom ~30 in recession as China-exposed."
BTC,220000,2025-10,"Current ~95-105k after correction from ~126k; halving cycle historically peaks 12-18 months post-halving (2024-04), pointing to Q4 2025; ETF inflows + potential strategic reserve hype drive final leg; fear/greed extreme fear now = contrarian buy signal; diminishing returns vs past cycles but institutional demand extends slightly; bottom ~80000 in late 2026."
ETH,8000,2025-11,"Follows BTC but with alt premium in euphoria phase; staking/L2 narrative + potential ETH ETF momentum; tops slightly after BTC; bottom ~3000 in 2026 bear."
BNB,1500,2025-12,"Binance ecosystem strength + BNB chain utility; lags BTC/ETH top but extends in alt season; meme/utility mix; bottom ~500."
WLD,25,2025-12,"Worldcoin (WLD) high speculation on Orb/biometric narrative; extreme volatility, rides late-cycle alt mania hardest; potential 10x from current but crashes 90%+ in bear; bottom ~3-5."
DOGE,2,2026-01,"Pure meme coin, Elon/tweet driven; often extends longest into greed phase with retail FOMO; splashiest top tick splash; bottom ~0.20-0.30 in 2026."
