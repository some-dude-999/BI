SPY,720,Jun 2026,"Current SPY ~660 (mid-Nov 2025) after peaking at ~687 in Oct 2025. Fear & Greed in extreme fear (~10-15), yield curve steepening (10y-2y positive ~0.5%), unemployment rising slowly. Recession risks elevated for 2026-2027 due to high debt, potential tariff shocks, AI capex slowdown, and overvalued tech (Shiller CAPE near dot-com levels). Many sources (Reddit, analysts) point to 2026 crash triggered by bubble burst or policy errors. Top tick assumes final melt-up on lingering AI/liquidity before crash starts mid-2026; ~10% upside from current levels realistic in euphoria phase."
QQQ,680,Jun 2026,"Current QQQ ~600 after Oct 2025 high ~636. Tech-heavy, more vulnerable to AI bubble deflation. Same macro risks as SPY but amplified (narrow breadth, mega-cap dependence). Expect similar final parabolic splash before 2026 recession/crash; ~13% upside from current."
BTC,185000,Dec 2025,"Current BTC ~91k after crashing from ~126k Oct high. Crypto F&G extreme fear (~10-15). Halving cycle historically peaks ~18 months post-halving (Oct-Nov 2025), but lengthening cycles + institutional inflows could push final top to year-end. Many Reddit/analyst predictions cluster 150-250k for cycle peak; 185k balances historical multiples with current suppression and potential ETF/treasury buying rebound."
ETH,6200,Dec 2025,"Current ETH ~3100. Tends to lag BTC then outperform late-cycle. If BTC tops 185k, ETH/BTC ratio rebound to ~0.033 gives ~6.2k. Ecosystem upgrades + staking demand support late-cycle strength."
BNB,1180,Dec 2025,"Current BNB ~920-930. Binance ecosystem resilient; follows BTC but less volatile. Modest outperformance expected in alt season phase of cycle."
WLD,2.10,Dec 2025,"Current WLD ~0.67-0.69. High-beta alt, tied to AI narrative. Extreme volatility; could 3-4x in final greed phase but highly speculative."
DOGE,0.68,Dec 2025,"Current DOGE ~0.16. Meme coin supreme; explosive late-cycle moves common. Potential for another 4x splash on hype/ETF rumors before cycle exhaustion."
