SPY,782.00,2026-05,"The Final Melt-Up driven by early 2026 rate cuts. Investors will chase the Soft Landing narrative one last time before the recession reality sets in Q3 2026. Current price ~661 is a local fear-bottom."
QQQ,685.00,2026-04,"AI capex bubble peaks. Tech earnings remain strong until mid-2026 when AI ROI questions finally cause a valuation reset. The peak coincides with peak rate-cut euphoria."
CQQQ,48.50,2025-02,"China tech already peaked on early 2025 reopening/stimulus hype. Trade tensions and 4% slowing GDP in H2 2025 make this a value trap. It will likely underperform the US blow-off top."
BTC,126080,2025-10,"The cycle top is likely IN. The run to 126k in 2025-10 was the ETF Institutional Mania. We are now in the Distribution Phase (2025-11 price ~92k). Expect a lower-high bounce to ~105k in Q1 2026 before the deep freeze."
ETH,5950,2025-10,"ETH beta to BTC remains high but diminishing against SOL. Peaked with BTC. Regulatory clarity in 2025 helped, but high gas fees during the mania limited the upside compared to 2021 multiples."
BNB,1050,2026-01,"BNB often lags. As the Casino House token, it benefits from the final retail speculation wave in early 2026 (alt-season echo). Regulatory survival (French probe resolution) provides the catalyst for a 4-digit squeeze."
WLD,11.82,2024-03,"WLD is an earlier cycle play. While it had a 2025 recovery to ~2.40, the true splash was the AI-hype peak in 2024. Facing massive regulatory headwinds (privacy) and token unlocks in late 2025/2026."
DOGE,0.42,2025-10,"Sympathy rally with BTC's ATH. Fueled by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) memes in US politics. It failed to breach the 2021 ATH (0.73) due to massive supply dilution since then."
