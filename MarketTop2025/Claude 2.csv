SPY,750,2026-03,"Currently at 660-665. Shiller CAPE at 2nd highest ever (only 1999 was higher). Buffett indicator at extreme. Yield curve un-inverted after longest inversion since 1970s - historically crashes follow un-inversion by 5-6 months. 18-year real estate cycle points to 2026 crash. Unemployment rising (4.3% from 3.7% low). Fear/Greed at extreme fear (9-12) suggests near-term bounce before final blow-off top. Target: +13% from current levels to reach euphoria before crash. Multiple analysts predict Q1-Q2 2026 market peak followed by 30-40% crash."
QQQ,680,2026-02,"Currently at 596. Tech heavily overvalued with AI bubble concerns. Already peaked at 637 in 2025-10. Death cross forming. ETF outflows accelerating. Narrowing market breadth with mega-caps carrying index. Target assumes one final AI-driven surge (+14% from current) before reality hits. More vulnerable than SPY to crash given tech concentration and extreme valuations. Expect 40-50% drawdown in crash."
CQQQ,72,2026-01,"Currently at 53. Chinese tech recovering from regulatory crackdowns but still well below 61 high. Geopolitical tensions limiting upside. May benefit from rotation out of US tech initially. Target: +36% surge if China stimulus continues and US-China relations stabilize temporarily. However extremely vulnerable to global recession - expect 50-60% crash from peak."
BTC,185000,2025-12,"Currently at 90-91k (down from 126k ATH 2025-10). Halving was April 2024. Historical pattern: peak 500-550 days post-halving = 2025-10-2026-02. Already hit 126k early (Oct) which is concerning. ETF outflows, extreme fear, death cross forming. Pi Cycle indicator accelerating toward convergence. Most models predict 150-200k peak. Target: Recovery to 185k as Fed potentially pivots to cuts, triggering final FOMO phase. Then 70-80% crash to 40-50k in 2026-27 bear market."
ETH,5800,2026-01,"Currently at 3,000-3,100 (down from near 5k ATH). Historically peaks 1-2 months after BTC. Fusaka upgrade 2025-12 could be catalyst. ETF outflows currently heavy but reversible. Target: 87% gain from current levels as DeFi/NFT mania returns briefly. Layer 2 scaling improvements drive final surge. Expect 75-85% drawdown in subsequent bear market to 800-1,200."
BNB,1450,2025-12,"Currently at 920-930 (ATH was 1,370). Most resilient large-cap in recent selloff. Binance ecosystem remains strong despite regulatory challenges. Target: Reclaim ATH + 6% as flight to quality exchange token before broader crypto crash. Benefits from being seen as safer crypto. Still expect 60-70% drawdown in bear to 400-500."
WLD,3.20,2025-11,"Currently at 0.67-0.69 (down 94% from 11.80 ATH). Highly speculative with Sam Altman association. Orb adoption remains limited. Target: 365% spike on AI narrative + speculation before reality of limited adoption hits. Most likely to peak earliest as speculation exhausts. Expect 90%+ crash to under 0.30 in bear market."
DOGE,0.38,2025-12,"Currently at 0.16-0.17 (recent high 0.48). Meme coin leader, benefits most from retail FOMO. Potential ETF catalyst. Target: 124% gain to 0.38 as retail euphoria peaks. Classic blow-off top pattern expected. Will crash 85-90% to 0.03-0.05 in bear market. Peak timing depends on Elon tweets and retail mania intensity."
