SPY,685.00,2025-10,"The Melt-Up Phase. Fed rate cuts in 2025 will initially fuel a massive rally. The top forms when the narrative shifts from Lower rates are good to Lower rates are because the economy is dying. The yield curve un-inversion is the final warning signal."
QQQ,615.00,2025-11,"AI bubble blow-off top. Tech leads the rally as lower yields boost growth stock valuations. The crash is triggered when AI capex spending is revealed to yield diminishing returns, coinciding with a consumer recession."
CQQQ,72.00,2025-08,"China Stimulus Rally. Likely to peak earlier than US markets. China will print money to offset trade war impacts, causing a violent squeeze in beaten-down tech giants (Tencent, Alibaba). Smart money exits this dead cat bounce before global recession hits."
BTC,142000,2025-12,"The 4-Year Cycle Peak. Historically, Bitcoin peaks ~18 months after the halving (April 2024). Institutional FOMO + Sovereign Wealth Fund adoption rumors drive the final vertical leg up. The Digital Gold narrative peaks right before the liquidity crisis forces a sell-off."
ETH,9200,2026-01,"The Wealth Effect Lag. Ethereum typically peaks 3-6 weeks after Bitcoin as profits rotate from BTC to ETH. The final leg is driven by a mania in DeFi/RWA (Real World Assets) on-chain before gas fees become exorbitant and the cycle ends."
BNB,1250,2025-12,"Exchange Mania. BNB acts as a proxy for retail crypto speculation. As retail returns in droves during the Q4 2025 mania, Binance revenue (and BNB burns) will hit record highs. Regulatory clouds will temporarily clear, allowing a massive pump."
WLD,14.50,2025-11,"AI + UBI Narrative. Worldcoin sits at the intersection of the two hottest bubbles: AI and Crypto. As AI displaces jobs (recession fear), the UBI narrative of Worldcoin will catch a massive viral speculative bid. Extremely high beta/risk."
DOGE,0.88,2025-11,"The Retail People's Top. Doge is the ultimate liquidity gauge. It will top when your Uber driver asks you how to buy it. Elon Musk's integration of crypto payments into X (Twitter) could be the catalyst that sends it to a nearly 1.00 psychological rejection."
