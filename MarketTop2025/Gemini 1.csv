SPY,$685.00,Oct 2025,"The Melt-Up Phase. Fed rate cuts in 2025 will initially fuel a massive rally. The top forms when the narrative shifts from Lower rates are good to Lower rates are because the economy is dying. The yield curve un-inversion is the final warning signal."
QQQ,$615.00,Nov 2025,"AI bubble blow-off top. Tech leads the rally as lower yields boost growth stock valuations. The crash is triggered when AI capex spending is revealed to yield diminishing returns, coinciding with a consumer recession."
CQQQ,$72.00,Aug 2025,"China Stimulus Rally. Likely to peak earlier than US markets. China will print money to offset trade war impacts, causing a violent squeeze in beaten-down tech giants (Tencent, Alibaba). Smart money exits this dead cat bounce before global recession hits."
BTC,$142000,Dec 2025,"The 4-Year Cycle Peak. Historically, Bitcoin peaks ~18 months after the halving (April 2024). Institutional FOMO + Sovereign Wealth Fund adoption rumors drive the final vertical leg up. The Digital Gold narrative peaks right before the liquidity crisis forces a sell-off."
ETH,$9200,Jan 2026,"The Wealth Effect Lag. Ethereum typically peaks 3-6 weeks after Bitcoin as profits rotate from BTC to ETH. The final leg is driven by a mania in DeFi/RWA (Real World Assets) on-chain before gas fees become exorbitant and the cycle ends."
BNB,$1250,Dec 2025,"Exchange Mania. BNB acts as a proxy for retail crypto speculation. As retail returns in droves during the Q4 2025 mania, Binance revenue (and BNB burns) will hit record highs. Regulatory clouds will temporarily clear, allowing a massive pump."
WLD,$14.50,Nov 2025,"AI + UBI Narrative. Worldcoin sits at the intersection of the two hottest bubbles: AI and Crypto. As AI displaces jobs (recession fear), the UBI narrative of Worldcoin will catch a massive viral speculative bid. Extremely high beta/risk."
DOGE,$0.88,Nov 2025,"The Retail People's Top. Doge is the ultimate liquidity gauge. It will top when your Uber driver asks you how to buy it. Elon Musk's integration of crypto payments into X (Twitter) could be the catalyst that sends it to a nearly $1.00 psychological rejection."
