SPY,$785,Jun 2026,"Current price ~$666 (Nov 2025). Yield curve re-steepening after 16-month inversion signals late-cycle dynamics. Record margin debt ($1.13T) growing 38.5% vs S&P's 17.6% mirrors 2000/2007/2021 peaks. Fed ending QT in Oct 2025 will fuel final liquidity-driven melt-up into Q2 2026. Unemployment rising 4.1%→4.3% and debt crisis concerns suggest recession will hit H2 2026. Expect 15-18% final rally to SPY $780-785 (S&P 500 ~7,500) before 30-40% crash. Extreme fear now (11/100) suggests bottoming before blow-off top."
QQQ,$735,Jun 2026,"Currently at $611 resistance. AI bubble momentum still intact despite extreme fear (tech stocks down 0.84% Nov 18). Margin debt surge historically leads QQQ peaks by 2-3 months. Fed pivot dovish supports risk assets through Q1 2026. Expect final euphoria phase as retail piles into tech, pushing QQQ to $735 (Nasdaq 100 ~18,500) by June. Valuations (Shiller CAPE) rival 1929 levels. Top coincides with crypto peak and before recession reality sets in. Tech earnings will disappoint as economy slows."
CQQQ,$73,May 2026,"Currently at $52.59. Chinese tech deeply oversold with 55.9% holdings in top 10. US-China tech tensions may temporarily ease post-2025 elections. China stimulus measures could spark relief rally. However, CQQQ is most vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and delisting risks. Top of $73 represents 39% upside from current levels - more modest than US counterparts due to structural headwinds. Will peak 4-6 weeks before SPY/QQQ as emerging markets lead downturn. Extreme fear in Chinese markets now (Feb 2025 lows) suggests bottoming process."
BTC,$195000,May 2026,"Currently ~$91K after falling from $126K Oct peak. JPMorgan called bottom at $94K production cost. Extreme fear (15/100) signals capitulation complete. Bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio trending down implies $170K theoretical price. Bloomberg bull case $150-200K. Final rally driven by: 1) ETF inflows resuming Q1 2026, 2) Trump crypto policy clarity, 3) Halving cycle momentum, 4) Institutional FOMO. Top at $195K represents 114% upside before devastating 60-70% crash. Will lead crypto downturn by 2-3 weeks vs equities."
ETH,$8450,Jun 2026,"Currently ~$3,100. Cowen predicts final rally to new ATHs before 2026 downturn. ETH/BTC peaked Aug 2025 - typical altcoin season pattern. Final push to $8,450 driven by: 1) ETF approval momentum, 2) Layer 2 adoption metrics, 3) DeFi TVL recovery, 4) Correlation with BTC final leg. Will top 2-4 weeks after BTC peak as altcoin speculation peaks. 170% upside from current. Bottom will be 75-80% drawdown to $1,800-2,000 range in Q1 2027."
BNB,$1875,Jun 2026,"Currently ~$915. Binance's deflationary burns and exchange dominance support price. Predictions range $532-$3,058. Will benefit from: 1) BNB Chain ecosystem growth, 2) Exchange volume surge during final rally, 3) Token burn mechanics. Top of $1,875 represents 105% upside. More resilient than pure spec coins but will still crash 60-65% to $650-700 bottom in recession. Regulatory clarity by mid-2026 will be catalyst for final push. Peaks with broader crypto market."
WLD,$4.20,Apr 2026,"Currently $0.67 with extreme fear (11/100) and bearish sentiment. Worldcoin's Sam Altman/AI narrative will attract speculation in final phase. Low float makes it vulnerable to massive volatility spikes. Top at $4.20 represents 527% pump - typical small-cap altcoin behavior in final 60 days of bull market. Will peak 3-4 weeks before BTC/ETH as riskiest assets top first. Most vulnerable to 85-90% crash due to: 1) Regulatory scrutiny of biometric data, 2) Limited adoption, 3) Low liquidity. Bottom target $0.35-0.40."
DOGE,$0.78,May 2026,"Currently $0.16. Memecoins historically peak in final 4-6 weeks of crypto bull cycles. Predictions up to $0.57 in 2026. Elon Musk's continued support and potential X integration will drive final mania. Top at $0.78 represents 388% upside. Will correlate with ETH/BTC ratio recovery. Extremely vulnerable to 80-85% crash as liquidity evaporates. Margin debt unwind will hit speculative assets hardest. Peaks 1-2 weeks before BTC top as retail capitulates last. Bottom target $0.08-0.10."
